# knapsack_dynamic_programming
Algorithms help us solve problems. There are many ways to design them, a method that I did not know until recently and that has been very interesting to know is the dynamic programming. The fundamental idea of ​​dynamic programming is to divide the problem into subproblems and then calculate each subproblem once. There are two approaches: top-down and bottom-up. Dynamic programming allows us to solve problems faster than with brute force, spending much more computer memory instead.  As explained thus, it is a little abstract, we are going to try to solve a classic dynamic programming problems, the knapsack problem (or the knapsack).
